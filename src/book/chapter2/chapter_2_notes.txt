JAVA OPERATORS
	TYPES OF OPERATORS
	   	Unary
	        Postfix
	            i++, i--
	        Prefix
	            ++i, --i
	        Other unary
	            +, -, !, ~
	    Binary          
	    	Arithmetic operators  
		        Multiplication/division/modulus        
		            *, /, %
		        Addition/subtraction
		            +, -
	        Shift operators
	            <<, >>, >>>
	        Relational operators
	            <, >, <=, >=, instanceof
	        Equality operators
	            ==, !=
	        Bitwise operators
	            &, ^, |
	        Short-circuit logical operators
	            &&, ||                        
	    Ternary
	        boolean expression ? expression1 : expression2
	    Assignment operators
	        =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=, >>>=	
	        	
	Multiplicative operators (*,/,%) have higher precedance than aditive operators (+,-)
			int x= 2*5+4*4; (10+16)	
			
	NUMERIC PROMOTION
		Rules:
			-if 2 values have different types, java will automatically promote both to the larger data type
			-if one value i integral and the other is floating both will be floating
			-smaller data types (byte,short,char) are FIRST promoted to int ANYTIME they are used with arithmetic operator even if they are both the same type (unary operators are excluded from this rule)
			-after all promotion has occurred the result will have the promoted data value as well	
			
	WORKING WITH UNARY OPERATORS
		-operator - reverses a value of a number to its negative (x=-x)
		-pre increment operator (++i)
			-the value is incremented first and then returned
		-post increment operator (i++)
			-the original value is returned first and then incremented
		int x=3;
		int y=++x*5/x--+--x; (4*5/4+2)
			
	ASSIGMENT OPERATORS
		-java will automatically convert from smaller to larger data types but not from larger to smaller
		double x=5; OK (converts from int to double)
		int y=5.00 DOES NOT COMPILE; (cannot convert from double to int)
		-result of an assignment operator is a result in and of itself
			System.out.println(x=3) //PRINTS 3
			- x=3 does 2 things. It sets x to 3 and returns value of x 		
						
		CASTING PRIMITIVE VALUES		
			-from larger data type to smaller or from decimal to integral	
			int x = (int) 1.0; OK
			short y= (short) 1921222 // Stored as 20678 because overflow
			short a=10;
			short b=12;
			short c= (short) a+b;
			
		COMPOUNT OPERATORS	
			long x=1;
			int y=5;
			y=y+x; //DOES NOT COMPILE
			y= (int) y+x;// OK
			y+=x;//AUTOMATICALLY CASTS TO INT 
			
	RELATIONAL OPERATORS
		- <,<=,>,>=
		- a instanceof b
		-return boolean value
		
	LOGICAL OPERATORS	
		- &,|,^ (BOTH SIDES GET EVALUATED)
		- &&,||(CONDITIONAL OPERATORS - SHORT CIRCUIT OPERATORS: FROM LEFT TO RIGHT. The right side may never be evaluated)
		-can be applied to numerical and boolean values
		-if to boolean they are logical operators
		-if to numbers they are bitwise operators (out of scope for OCA)
		- a^b -> if exactly one is true and another false (EXCLUSIVE OR)
		
	EQUALITY OPERATORS
		-used when comparing numbers, boolean or objects		
		-  5==5.00 //TRUE because the left side is promoted to a double
		-with objects it compares the references not the actual objects
		-references are equal if they point to the same object or are both null
		
	UNDERSTANDING JAVA STATEMENTS:
		-be careful of unreachable code with if else
		int x=1
		if(x){}//DOES NOT COMPILE, BECAOUSE X IS NOT BOOLEAN
		-switch can not be boolean or long
		-pay attention to missing break statements in switch
		-switch values have to be compile time constants (literals,enums or final)
		-switch supports a lot of data types
		-while takes boolean as argument
		-do while guarantees the statement will be executed at least once (statement executes before evaluation)
		- for (initialization;booleanExpression;updateStatement){}
		-for ( ; ; ) //will compile - infinite loop
		- variables in the initialization block in for loop must all be of the same type
		-for each is for collection objects
		
	UNDERSTANDING ADVANCE FLOW CONTROL
		-optional labels 
		-if does not allow break statements
		-switch does not allow continue
